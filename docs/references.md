This playbook draws upon the collective wisdom and pioneering work of many individuals and research groups in the fields of software engineering, agile methodologies, DevOps, and product development. Below are some of the key influences and resources that have informed our approach:

## Thought Leaders & Key Works

- **Kent Beck:**

  - _Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change._ Addison-Wesley Professional, 2000.
  - Numerous articles and talks on Agile software development, XP, and software design.

## Key Concepts & Methodologies

- **DORA Metrics:** The four key metrics (Lead Time for Changes, Deployment Frequency, Change Failure Rate, Mean Time to Recovery) highlighted by the Accelerate State of DevOps reports.
- **Extreme Programming (XP):** Principles and practices available through various books, articles, and community resources (e.g., extremeprogramming.org).
- **Continuous Delivery (CD) & Continuous Integration (CI):** Foundational DevOps practices detailed in the works above and numerous online resources.
- **Agile Manifesto:** The foundational document for agile software development (agilemanifesto.org).

This list is not exhaustive but represents some of the most significant direct influences on the thinking presented in this playbook. We encourage you to explore these resources further to deepen your understanding of modern software development and product delivery practices.
